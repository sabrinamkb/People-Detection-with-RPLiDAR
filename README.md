# People-Detection-with-RPLiDAR

This is an R&D task that I'm currently working on as part of my internship. The main goal is to create a pre-built map from the laser data provided by the RPLiDAR A1 and using that to detect people on the pre-built map. The LiDAR will be placed in a stationary position on the floor. The goal will be achieved by using ROS.
